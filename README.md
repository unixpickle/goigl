# goigl

Incomplete, quick and hacky Go bindings for libigl. The main reason I created this was to perform boolean operations over [model3d](https://github.com/unixpickle/model3d) meshes.

# Installation

You must be able to use cgo (e.g. have a C compiler on your system, etc.). You must also install [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) on your system.

To install CGAL on Ubuntu, run:

```
sudo apt install libcgal-dev
```
